// search button does two main things:
// search will take the given city name, and will give default results for the state, zip code, and country
// search will then add the necessary information to the OpenWeather API URL, creating a unique link to a specific city with it's weather information
// search button will finally take the located data and will fill the <div day 1-5> elements on the html
// search results will be listed both in front end and back end of web page
